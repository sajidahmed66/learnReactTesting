### Jest and React testing

Jest: jest is a test runner that finds a test, runs a test, determines whether the tests passed or failed and reports it back.

React-testing-libary: js testing utility that provides a vertualdom for testing React components

Types of automated tests

1. Unit tests: Focus is on individual building blocks of an application such as Function or class or a component. Each unit or building block is tested in isolation, independent of other units. Dependencies are mocked. Run in a short amount of time and make it very easier to pinpont failures. Relatively easier to run , write and maintain.
2. Intrigation test: Focus on testing a combination of units and ensuring they work together.
3. E2E tests: Endtoend test Focus on testing the entire application Flow and ensureing it works properly from start to finish. It involves UI backed and takes longer to complete as the cover most amount of codes
